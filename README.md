Customer Churn Prediction 

Predicting customer attrition before it happens

Customer churnâ€”when customers stop using a serviceâ€”is a major challenge for subscription-based businesses. This project uses machine learning to identify customers at risk of leaving, helping businesses take proactive retention measures.

Goal: Build a predictive model that can classify customers as likely to churn or likely to stay, enabling data-driven retention strategies.

Problem Statement:

Losing customers is costly.
Acquiring a new customer can cost 5â€“25Ã— more than retaining an existing one.
By predicting churn early, businesses can:

Offer tailored incentives to high-risk customers

Improve customer experience

Reduce revenue loss
